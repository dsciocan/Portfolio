The About page contains a short description about me and my coding journey. 

The Projects page contains a series of my past projects. Hovering on each of them will reveal links to the websites/repos they can be accessed from.

The Contact page contains a form you can fill in if you want to get in touch, as well as links to other profiles/ways of contacting me.
